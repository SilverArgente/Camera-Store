Your participation in the Service is personal to you, and you may not assign or transfer your enrollment, or any of the benefits of the Service, to any third party without our authorization. The Service is only available to customers with shipping addresses in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia.<br><br><strong>Offers, Orders and Returns</strong><br>Discounts and any limited time promotions associated with the Service apply only to Eligible Products displaying the offer message on the product detail page on the Canon Direct website (shop.usa.canon.com). Discounts and any amounts from limited time promotions that apply to your order, if any, and which are still in effect, will be automatically deducted from your order.<br><br>Some offer details may change as you receive deliveries over time (for example, price, taxes, availability, and shipping charges). If an Eligible Product is unavailable when we plan to ship it, we will notify you that we are unable to process your order, and we will wait to process your order until the next scheduled shipping date when the Eligible Product is available. When the Eligible Product becomes available, the price will be the price when you ordered it, regardless of when it becomes available.<br><br>Returns of Eligible Products under the Service are subject to our&nbsp;<a tabindex="0" href="https://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog/shopping-buying#rp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">return policy</a>. Service enrollments are void where prohibited.<br><br><strong>Enrollment</strong><br>As part of your enrollment in the Service, you will be required to register with us so that your printer can be identified as participating in the Service. Instructions for registering your printer are contained in the introductory email sent to you after you apply for enrollment in the Service, as well as in the "My Account" section of the Canon Direct website (shop.usa.canon.com). You will be required to accept terms and conditions provided by our parent company, Canon Inc., as part of registering your printer. Canon Inc. will notify us when an ink or toner cartridge reaches a certain low ink/toner threshold, and we will fill an order for the ink or toner and ship it to you under these Terms. Information provided to us and Canon Inc. may be stored on servers outside of the United States and will be subject to our Privacy Statement. It's possible that your order for Eligible Products will not arrive prior to running out of ink or toner where your use was more than usual, particularly if such greater use occurred over 1 or 2 days.<br><br><strong>Payment and Cancellation</strong><br>The total cost charged to your payment method for each order under the Service will be the cost of the Eligible Product on the day that order is processed, less any discount offered as a percentage or dollars off at the time you registered, plus any applicable sales tax. We reserve the right to modify or cancel any discount offered at the time you registered for the Service, with notice to you, and future orders fulfilled under the Service will reflect any such change.<br><br>For each Eligible Product shipped under the Service, you authorize us to charge the payment method used when you enrolled unless otherwise directed by you. If we are unable to complete your order with the payment method you used when you enrolled, we will not fulfill the order and will notify you that your payment method needs to be updated.<br><br>Your enrollment in the Service will remain in effect until it is canceled. You can cancel or modify your enrollment at any time via the "My Account" section of the Canon Direct website (shop.usa.canon.com). If you cancel or modify your enrollment after an order has been processed, you will be charged for the order as processed. If the discount for such Eligible Product changes, the new discount will be applied to your future shipments of that Eligible Product. If, after enrollment, you are no longer in possession of your printer for any reason (e.g., due to warranty return, replacement, or exchange), the total cost for the Service will continue to be charged to your payment method until you cancel your enrollment. No refunds will be granted because of your failure to cancel your enrollment in such situation.<br><br>Your rights under these Terms will automatically terminate without notice if you fail to comply with any of its terms and conditions. In the event of such termination, we may immediately revoke your access to the Service. Our failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with these Terms and will not constitute a waiver of any of our rights.<br><br><strong>Changes to Terms</strong><br>We may, in our sole discretion, change these Terms without notice to you. If any change to these Terms is found invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that change is severable and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining changes or conditions. YOUR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION AFTER WE CHANGE THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY CHANGES, YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR ENROLLMENT.<br><br><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability</strong><br>WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, CONCERNING THE SERVICE INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

<h2>PRODUCT ELIGIBILITY</h2>
<p>This Service Contract covers Products purchased as new or factory-refurbished and manufactured for use in the
    United States, which, at the time of Product purchase, included a Canon USA, Inc. limited warranty valid in the
    United States providing minimum coverage of one (1) year parts and labor. The original Service Contract must be
    purchased within ninety (90) days of purchase of Your Product. Purchase of this Service Contract is not required
    to purchase the Product or to obtain financing for the Product. Coverage outlined in this Service Contract only
    applies to Products not covered under any other insurance warranty, guarantee and/or service contract providing
    the same benefits as outlined herein. Products must be purchased from a Retailer, and be solely intended for
    personal use, and not intended for Commercial Use or for resale. Accessories, external peripheral devices and/or
    add-on options are not covered under this Service Contract.</p>
<h2>RENEWAL</h2>
<p>Subject to this section, Your original Service Contract can be renewed. The renewal must be purchased no sooner
    than ninety (90) days prior to expiration date of the original Service Contract Term and not after such date. In
    no event, however, will the combined Term of your manufacturer's Limited Warranty, original Service Contract and
    any Service Contract renewal period exceed the maximum coverage time period of five (5) years from date of
    Product purchase. Coverage during the renewal period will be governed by the then current version of the Service
    Contract Terms & Conditions which must be agreed to in order for the renewal period to become effective. To
    renew Your Service Contract, sign into Your Canon Account at <a href="https://usa.canon.com"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">usa.canon.com</a> to view your eligible products or call 1-833-CAREPAK (1-833-227-3725).</p>
<h2>YOUR RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
<p><strong>PRODUCT PROTECTION:</strong> If damage or breakdown of the Product is suspected, You should promptly take
    reasonable precautions in order to protect against further damage.</p>
<h2>SERVICE CONTRACT TERM</h2>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; font-weight: bold;">
    <li>Damage resulting from Power Surge or Accidental Damage from Handling ("ADH"): <span
            style="font-weight: normal;">Coverage for damages to Your Product resulting from Power Surge or
            Accidental Damage From Handling, begins on the date of Product purchase or delivery (if different from
            Product purchase date), and continues for the Term shown on Your Contract Purchase Receipt.</span></li>
    <li>Failure resulting from Mechanical/Electrical Breakdown: <span style="font-weight: normal;">Coverage for
            Failure of Your Product resulting from mechanical or electrical breakdown as described in the definition
            of "Failure" begins upon expiration of the shortest portion of the manufacturer's original parts and/or
            labor limited warranty and continues for the remainder of Your Term.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>WHAT IS COVERED – GENERAL</h2>
<p>In accordance with the SERVICE CONTRACT TERM described above, We agree to procure the necessary services to
    restore Your Product to standard operating condition at Our discretion, which may result in a replacement of
    Your originally covered Product in lieu of repair services, if Your Product experiences a Failure or damage from
    Accidental Damage From Handling ("ADH") or Power Surge.</p>
<p>If provided to You, a replacement product may be a new or refurbished product of equal or similar features and
    functionality, but not necessarily the same model. Please refer to the LIMIT OF LIABILITY section for full
    details regarding Product replacements.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: COVERAGE DESCRIBED IN THIS SERVICE CONTRACT WILL NOT REPLACE OR PROVIDE DUPLICATIVE BENEFITS DURING
    ANY ACTIVE MANUFACTURER'S LIMITED WARRANTY PERIOD. DURING SUCH PERIOD, ALL PARTS, LABOR, ON-SITE SERVICE AND/OR
    SHIPPING COSTS COVERED BY THAT LIMITED WARRANTY ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANUFACTURER (WHO IS CANON
    U.S.A., INC.) PARTS USED TO REPAIR OR REPLACE YOUR PRODUCT MAY BE NEW, USED, REFURBISHED, OR NON-ORIGINAL
    MANUFACTURER PARTS THAT PERFORM TO THE FACTORY SPECIFICATIONS OF YOUR PRODUCT. Where applicable, technological
    advances may result in a replacement product with a lower selling price than Your original Product, and no
    refunds will be made based on the replacement product cost difference.</p>
<p>This Service Contract is valid for repairs or replacement within the United States of America, its territories or
    Canada.</p>
<h2>ADDITIONAL BENEFITS INCLUDED IN YOUR PLAN</h2>
<p>In addition to coverage for a Failure, Your Contract also provides coverage for:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; font-weight: bold;">
    <li>ACCIDENTAL DAMAGE FROM HANDLING (ADH): <span style="font-weight: normal;">labor and/or parts required to
            repair Your Product, or at Our sole discretion, replacement of Your original Product in lieu of repair
            in consideration of sudden and unforeseen ADH.</span></li>
    <li>COMPLIMENTARY CUSTOMER SUPPORT: <span style="font-weight: normal;">During your Service Contract Term and
            upon validation of CarePAK coverage with an active Canon Account, Your Contract includes agent-assisted

                href="mailto:carepakplus@cits.canon.com">carepakplus@cits.canon.com</a>.</span></li>
    <li>NO LEMON GUARANTEE: <span style="font-weight: normal;">Within any consecutive twelve (12) month period, if
            Your Product has three (3) repairs covered under Your Contract for the same problem and a fourth (4th)
            repair is required for the same problem and considered covered under Your Contract, We will replace Your
            Product with one of like kind and quality, but not necessarily same model, or, at Our sole discretion,
            provide You with reimbursement equal to the fair market value of the Product as determined by Us based
            upon the age of the Product and subject to the LIMIT OF LIABILITY section. Any repair services performed
            while Your Product is under its manufacturer's warranty or in association with ADH are not considered to
            be qualifying service repairs under this benefit.</span></li>
    <li>CANON MAINTENANCE SERVICE FOR CAMERAS AND EF/RF LENSES: <span style="font-weight: normal;">You are entitled
            to one (1) Canon Maintenance Service (CMS) procedure per covered Product per year for each year of
            coverage during the coverage period. This service includes 18-point Digital SLR Maintenance Service

<h2>DEDUCTIBLE</h2>
<p>There is no Deductible required to obtain service on Your Product under this Service Contract.</p>
<h2>OBTAINING SERVICE</h2>
<p><strong>IN ORDER FOR A CLAIM TO BE CONSIDERED, YOU WILL NEED TO FIRST CONTACT THE ADMINISTRATOR FOR APPROVAL AND
        A REPAIR AUTHORIZATION NUMBER. IMPORTANT: THE SUBMISSION OF A CLAIM DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY MEAN THAT THE
        DAMAGE OR BREAKDOWN TO YOUR PRODUCT IS COVERED UNDER YOUR SERVICE CONTRACT. THE ADMINISTRATOR MUST VALIDATE
        AND PROVIDE YOU WITH APPROVAL (I.E. A REPAIR AUTHORIZATION NUMBER) FOR YOUR SUBMITTED CLAIM PRIOR TO ANY
        BENEFITS BEING CONSIDERED UNDER THIS CONTRACT.</strong></p>
<p>THIS SERVICE CONTRACT MAY NOT PROVIDE ANY COVERAGE IF YOU MAKE UNAUTHORIZED REPAIRS. Upon validation of CarePAK
    coverage, Canon will make commercially reasonable efforts to service and ship Your repair or replacement within
    five (5) business days after you receive the No Charge Repair Acknowledgement correspondence via email and
    subject to availability of parts or replacement Product. Note that business days are Monday through Friday,
    9am-5pm, and exclude Canon observed holidays, and any periods where unavailability is due to circumstances
    beyond Canon's control.</p>
<p>If You need to file a Claim under this Service Contract or verify Your coverage, call the Administrator's
    Customer Care Center at 1-833-CAREPAK (1-833-227-3725). To expedite service, please have Your Contract Purchase
    Receipt readily available. The Administrator will confirm Your Service Contract coverage and collect any
    additional information necessary from You and about Your covered Product. When You receive authorization for
    service on Your Product under this Contract, You will also receive further instructions on how to obtain such
    service. In general:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>If Your covered Product is a camera, video, lens, flash, projector or binoculars, You can also arrange for
        service under this Contract online by visiting the Administrator's Product Repair Page at
        www.usa.canon.com/support.</li>
    <li>If Your covered Product is a printer, scanner or multifunction printer, the Administrator is unable to
        authorize service for these particular products through its website; You must call the Administrator's
        Customer Care Center at 1-833-CAREPAK (1-833-227-3725) to initiate service.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please do not take or return Your Product to the Retailer or ship Your Product anywhere unless the Administrator
    instructs You to do so. If You are instructed by the Administrator to transport or ship Your Product, be sure to
    include the following with Your Product:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li>(1) a copy of Your Contract Purchase Receipt;</li>
    <li>(2) a brief written description of the problem You are experiencing with the Product; and</li>
    <li>(3) a prominent notation of Your repair authorization number that the Administrator gave You.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please use caution when transporting and/or shipping Your Product as directed by the Administrator, as We are not
    liable for any freight charges or damages due to improper packaging by You or Your representative.</p>
<p>If Your Term expires during the time of an approved Claim, Your coverage under the Contract will be extended
    until the date in which Your approved Claim in progress has been fulfilled completely in accordance with the
    terms and conditions of this Service Contract.</p>
<h2>LIMIT OF LIABILITY</h2>
<p>During the Term of Your Service Contract, the maximum amount that We are obligated to pay for services in
    connection with all Claims pursuant to this Service Contract is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:">
    <li>One (1) Product replacement for a covered Claim for ADH damage (in which Your replacement product is
        ineligible for continued coverage under Your original Contract); OR</li>
    <li>Two (2) Product replacements for covered Claims for Power Surge or Failures (in which Your replacement
        products are automatically covered under Your original
        Contract for the remainder of Your Term).</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the first limit has been met, Our obligation under this Contract is considered fulfilled in its entirety and
    coverage ends.</p>
<p>NEITHER WE NOR THE ADMINISTRATOR NOR THE RETAILER SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES;
    INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOST TIME OR LOST DATA RESULTING FROM THE FAILURE OF ANY PRODUCT

    </div>
    <div class="t-header-bold">Eligibility</div>
    <div class="t-c-1">The Canon eCarePAK Extended Service Plan (the "eCarePAK") is provided by Canon U.S.A., Inc. ("CUSA") with respect to the Canon product and/or Canon Accessory, and the service(s) (Repair or Replacement, Installation, Training, and/or Preventative Maintenance), identified on your eCarePAK Certificate of Registration for which the eCarePAK has been purchased (the "Covered Product"). CUSA reserves the right to verify the information you provide to CUSA in connection with your registration for the eCarePAK and may reject your enrollment. The purchase of an eCarePAK is not required either to purchase the Covered Product or to obtain financing for the Covered Product.</div>
    <div class="t-header-bold">Activating the eCarePAK</div>
    <div class="t-c-1">If you do not agree with the Terms and Conditions of the eCarePAK, you may cancel and obtain a refund in accordance with the section entitled "Ability to Cancel and Right to Refund" below. The eCarePAK becomes effective when CUSA registers your Covered Product. You may purchase an eCarePAK within the term of the CUSA Limited Warranty for the Covered Product, or before any existing eCarePAK covering the Covered Product has expired. However, if you decide to purchase after the Limited Warranty has expired, or after any existing eCarePAK on the Covered Product has expired, CUSA reserves the right to inspect the Covered Product, at your expense, and to refuse to register your Covered Product, in its sole discretion, if it does not meet CUSA’s requirements for coverage under an eCarePAK. An eCarePAK Certificate of Registration will be sent to you upon registration of your extended service plan and/or preventative maintenance (“Preventative Maintenance”) plans.</div>
    <div class="t-header-bold">Coverage</div>
    <div class="t-c-1">Coverage under the eCarePAK will begin effective on the expiration date of the original CUSA Limited Warranty or existing eCarePAK for the Covered Product, as applicable, and continue until the expiration date indicated on your eCarePAK Certificate of Registration. The period between the effective date of coverage under your eCarePAK and the expiration date indicated on your eCarePAK Certificate of Registration is referred to herein as the “Term”.<span>* THIS IS NOT A CONTRACT OF INSURANCE.</span>
    <br><span>*</span>The Term for certain Covered Products will expire prior to the expiration date indicated on your eCarePAK Certificate of Registration if the number of printed pages for your Covered Product reaches the maximum allowed, as provided below:
    <ul class="t-list" style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li class="t-c-1">MAXIFY GX X: Maximum of 80,000 printed pages by the Covered Product.</li>
        <li class="t-c-1">WG Series Inkjet Printer: Maximum of 300,000 printed pages by the Covered Product.
            Should the page count exceed the listed maximum printed page count for these Products only, the eCarePAK coverage will no longer apply regardless of the expiration date printed on the eCarePAK Certificate. All repairs requested beyond the printed page limit will be excluded from coverage under the eCarePAK .</li>

Any parts that are replaced will become the property of CUSA. Replacement of parts will not extend the Term of the eCarePAK. Likewise, if CUSA should replace the Covered Product, the original Covered Product will become the property of CUSA. Coverage under the eCarePAK will automatically transfer to the replacement product but will not extend the Term.</li>
        <li class="t-c-1">The eCarePAK is valid only for service of a Covered Product purchased and used in the United
